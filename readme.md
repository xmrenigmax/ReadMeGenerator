create a command-line tool that automatically generates a basic README.md file for projects. Let's break this down into a minimal viable product (v1) that you can expand later.
v1 Features

    Title Generation: Uses the root directory name as the project title

    Basic Description: Creates a placeholder description section

    Language Detection: Identifies project languages and adds badges

    File Structure: Creates README.md in the root directory

    Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Recommended Technology Stack

Since you want it to work in any language environment and be terminal-usable, I recommend:

    Node.js (JavaScript) - Good for cross-platform CLI tools with easy distribution via npm

        Alternative: Python (if you prefer)

    Key Dependencies:

        chalk - For colored terminal output

        inquirer - For interactive prompts (future versions)

        simple-git - For Git repository detection (future versions)

        language-detect - For detecting project languages
